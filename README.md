## Tips

The objects are only brought out once the competition starts. All of these are **sourced in the host country from their local stores**.

The best thing to do, is not to stress over getting exact matches for the originals. You won't. They haven't been purchased yet. Instead, train your system to recognize a wide variety of the versions of the objects that you find mentioned in the tasks, as well as in the command generator grammar. When you get to the competition, there will be time to customize your system.

Make sure you have a way to **quickly gather data to train a classifier**. There are other teams that want to have the objects as well for the same purpose, so efficiency is key.
